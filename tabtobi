1. Extract Stage
Goal: Extract metadata and data assets from Tableau for migration.

Steps:
Connect to Tableau Server/Desktop:

Use Tableau's REST API or Server Client (TSC) to authenticate and access workbooks, datasources, and dashboards.
Extract the following:
Data Sources: Connection details (e.g., databases, queries).
Metadata: Columns, tables, relationships, hierarchies, joins.
Calculated Fields: Logic and expressions (in Tableau's syntax).
Filters and Parameters: User interactivity elements.
Dashboard Layouts: Visual metadata in XML or JSON.
Export Data Extracts:

Export Tableau data extracts as CSV or connect directly to data sources for Power BI ingestion.
Tools:
Tableau REST API or TSC Library.
Python scripts for API automation.
Tableau’s command-line utilities (tabcmd) for batch extraction.
2. Transform Stage
Goal: Convert Tableau assets into Power BI-compatible formats.

Steps:
Data Connection Mapping:

Map Tableau data sources to Power BI’s connectors.
Transform any driver-specific settings (e.g., OAuth, database drivers).
Convert Data Model:

Use scripts to translate Tableau’s relationships, joins, and hierarchies into Power BI’s tabular model.
Example: Convert Tableau joins to Power BI relationships with cardinality and filters.
Transform Calculations:

Parse Tableau’s calculated fields and translate them into DAX expressions.
For unsupported Tableau functions, implement equivalent DAX logic.
Map Filters and Parameters:

Convert Tableau filters to Power BI slicers.
Migrate Tableau parameters to Power BI fields with equivalent functionality.
Dashboard Layout Conversion:

Map Tableau dashboard visualizations to Power BI visuals.
Automate layout recreation using Power BI JSON templates.
Tools:
Python scripts (e.g., pandas, regex for parsing calculations).
JSON processors for layout transformation.
Power BI Tabular Editor for automating model creation.
3. Load Stage
Goal: Rebuild the data model, visuals, and interactivity in Power BI.

Steps:
Create Data Models:

Use the Power BI REST API or XMLA endpoint to programmatically create datasets.
Define relationships, hierarchies, and measures in the dataset.
Rebuild Visuals:

Use Power BI REST API to create visuals, dashboards, and reports dynamically.
For unsupported Tableau visuals, integrate Power BI custom visuals.
Publish to Power BI Service:

Deploy datasets and reports to the Power BI workspace.
Configure RLS and workspace access.
Embed Parameters:

Implement parameters and filters using Power BI’s slicers and query parameters.
Tools:
Power BI REST API.
Tabular Editor for dataset creation.
PowerShell scripts for batch deployment.
4. Validation Stage
Goal: Ensure data consistency and visual fidelity.

Steps:
Data Validation:

Compare data between Tableau and Power BI (e.g., row counts, aggregations).
Use SQL queries to verify dataset consistency.
Calculation Validation:

Validate Tableau calculated fields against their DAX equivalents.
Visual Fidelity:

Compare visuals manually or use automated screenshot comparison tools (e.g., Selenium).
Performance Testing:

Test Power BI reports for load time and refresh efficiency.
Optimize the data model for in-memory performance.
5. Deployment Stage
Goal: Publish and operationalize Power BI reports and dashboards.

Steps:
Configure Workspaces:

Automate workspace setup in Power BI Service.
Assign roles and permissions.
Report Distribution:

Automate report subscriptions and email alerts.
Schedule data refreshes.
Monitoring:

Use Power BI’s Audit Logs to monitor report usage and identify issues.
Documentation:

Generate automated documentation for datasets, relationships, measures, and visuals.
Framework Architecture
The automation framework can be organized using modular pipelines:

Orchestration:

Use Apache Airflow, Azure Data Factory, or Power Automate to manage the workflow.
Trigger events based on task completion.
ETL Scripts:

Write Python or PowerShell scripts for each step.
Example:
Extract: Use Python to fetch Tableau metadata.
Transform: Use pandas to parse and convert metadata.
Load: Use PowerShell to interact with Power BI APIs.
Validation Pipeline:

Integrate automated testing scripts for QA.
CI/CD Pipeline:

Use Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment of Power BI assets.
Technological Stack
Languages: Python (primary), PowerShell.
APIs: Tableau REST API, Power BI REST API.
ETL: Alteryx, Talend, or custom scripts.
Workflow Orchestration: Apache Airflow, Azure Logic Apps.
Validation Tools: SQL queries, Selenium for UI validation.
